# C.R.U.D-on-users

This is a backend project that has the gool to make a full C.R.U.D on the users. 

I used the mvc structure, typescript, express.js, express validator, mysql and typeorm as the database manager.

To setup the project, you have to download it and config your .env to your local database configurations and then run  ```npm run dev``` 
on the root folder. if it doesn't run, try ```npm install``` and the run again.
